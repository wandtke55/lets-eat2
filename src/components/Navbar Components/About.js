                Hi my name is Christian Wandtke! I made this website for my personal project, and as a portfolio piece for what I can do as a developer to show future employers.

                As a kid I always was fascinated by computers and how they worked. Trying to figure things out on my own and seeing it work on the screen always made me feel great! I was introduced to DevMountain by a friend and after seeing the successes and web applications he was creating, it peaked my interest into the industry. I am currently striving to make this my full-time occupation and hopefully a career in the near future.

                The inspiration for this app came from dating my amazing girlfriend. We are both indecisive people when it comes to choosing where to eat. When I asked her if she had any ideas about what I could build for a personal project, she instantly told me to create something to help us choose where to have dinner. Thus Lets-Eat! was created and is here to help us solve this issue of not caring where we eat.
